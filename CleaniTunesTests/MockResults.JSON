            "longDescription": "Marty had a heart condition that made her pass out every day. Adele was a     cardiac alert service dog who could literally sense the beating of Marty’s heart and     save her from fainting. They were the perfect team. They were soulmates. But nothing     can last forever, and as the time comes for Adele’s retirement, Marty must figure out     how to let go of her best friend and find a new partner who can take over the job of     protecting her heart. With Adele by her side, Marty went from being unable to walk     around the block without passing out, to leading an adventurous, joy-filled life as a     wife, mother and artist. She doesn’t want to go back to how it was before Adele, but     going forward is just as scary. The film follows Marty and Adele on the rocky, painful,     but ultimately life-affirming journey to letting go."

The film’s narrative unfolds through a series of storylines: We follow Shannan, as she begins her journey with Dave and this medicine, uncovering child-hood trauma buried deep inside her sub-conscious. We hear from Lisa, a recovering heroin and crack addict that worked as a prostitute in the streets of Toronto.  We also hear from Gabor Mate, whom through talk therapy, helps participants uncover how their experiences with Ayahuasca relate to their daily lives. And finally we hear from Libby.  Who starts her journey with this plant by leaving a suicide message on her phone that thankfully never gets delivered."

With sold out concerts around the world and multiple awards to her name Adele came from humble beginnings and has gone on to be one of the biggest Artists in the world. This programme tells her incredible story. From a very early age Adele Laurie Blue Adkins showed a keen interest in music. In 2006 she graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon along with Leona Lewis and Jessie J. It was that same year that she came to the attention of the world on MySpace after a friend posted her demo. From this point her remarkable career took off. Adele released her debut album 19 in 2008 where it went on to commercial and critical success being certified four times platinum in the UK. This success was also reflected in the United States where she won several Grammy Awards in 2009. Her second album 21 was released in early 2011, surpassed the success of her debut album earning six Grammy Awards and two Brit Awards in 2012 and it has been certified 14 times platinum in the UK. Through her own words, video and live performance footage of some of her greatest hits including Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, Love song, Hometown Glory, Chasing Pavements, Cold Shoulder and Make You Feel My Love this DVD takes an incredible look at the life and times of this truly amazing young artist ."

            "longDescription": "One of the films that spread the good name of Czech cinema around the world was the detective parody Adéla ještě nevečeřela (Adela Has Not Had Her Supper Yet). During the making of the film, the director Oldřich Lipský once again teamed up with screenwriter Jiří Brdečka, whose initial story had already been used by him to write and shoot the 1964 cowboy parody Limonádový Joe aneb Koňská opera (Lemonade Joe). Just like Joe in that movie, Adele derived from the authors’ fascination with American pulp fiction and trashy cinema, which had long been forgotten in the Czech lands by the time the film was being made. The protagonist is the private detective Nick Carter – a literary creation that had been appearing in film in various guises since the silent era. Brdečka and Lipský, however, placed the “best American sleuth” – a manly genius armed with sophisticated technology – in secession-era Prague at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. For the character played by the Slovak actor Michal Dočolomanský (redubbed by František Němec), this is an “exotic” world full of unexpected surprises. The brilliant American is meant to help the experienced Commissar Ledvina (Rudolf Hrušínský) – a genial, hedonistic connoisseur of the Prague underworld and of Pilsner beer – in solving the case of a mysterious disappearance from the Countess Thun’s house. The duo – who are like chalk and cheese – end up on the trail of the evil Baron von Kratzmar (played by the excellent Miloš Kopecký), who has cultivated the eponymous Adele, a huge flesh-eating plant whose taste buds are always whetted by the strains of Mozart’s Schlafe, mein Prinzchen. A product of the surrealist imagination of the artist Jan Švankmajer, Adele is the main, but not the only, attraction in this entertaining film, which revels in gags based on situational comedy and wordplay that often stem from the contrast between the impeccable detective and the illogical, erratic Czech milieu."
